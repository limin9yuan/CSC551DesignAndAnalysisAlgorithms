brute_force_n2
I write two nest for loop each for loop run n times. So total ruuning time is n2.

3.
If n choose 2 formula is n!/(2! *(n - 2)!)
			=(n * (n-1) * (n-2)!)/(2! * (n -2)!)
			get rid of (n-2)!
			=(n2-2n+1)/2
			ignore constants
			So running time is n2.

brute_force_n3
I let brute_force_n2 run another n times. So total running time is n3
